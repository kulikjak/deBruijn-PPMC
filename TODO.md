# Todo list

Implementation and possible text todo list for this thesis

## Simple version:
* red black tree support - done
* implement comparable structures up to the deBruijn graph - done

## Compact version:
* red black tree support - done
* rank support - done
* select support - done
* de Bruijn graph operations - done
* compression of given text - done
* arithmetic coding output of compression - done

* write more and better tests - done
* add tests for P array - done

* decompression of compressed text - done
* extensive tests for compression and decompression - done

* move code tracker from compressor/decompressor - done
* change several functions to macros - done
* code deduplication - done

---

three different memory managers:
* indexed memory - done
* preallocated pointed memory - done

* implement PPMD for testing purposes with 7zip - done
	- Image and Text Compression (Storer)

* implement RaS based context shortening

* memory should be global and not associated with stucture (?)

* code refactoring and nicening
* optimizations of algorithms

* benchmarks for all versions


## Text (among all other):

* removal of third vector
* removal of pointers in graph structure
* compression vs memory usage (size of P values)

* info about existing SDSL library
