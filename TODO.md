# Todo list / possible upgrades

* Dynamic bit vector - add posibility to find first lower
    * this is needed for the RaS context shortening
    * right now it doesn't work correctly
* variable sized nodes, especially the probability counters
* addition of N symbol (used by the sequencing software when the base is unknown or not interesting)
