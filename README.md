# Succinct PPMC algorithm
PPMC compression algorithm using succinct deBruijn graphs as an underliying structure.

**This project is still work in progress**

DeBruijn graph is supported by dynamic succint bit vectors and wavelet tree which support rank and select operations as well as additions (deletion can be supported pretty easily, but it is not needed for PPM compression).
